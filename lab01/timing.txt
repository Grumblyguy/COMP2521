Our program performs much better on the reverse and sorted lists as the number
of processes needed to find the correct node spot to insert is reduced significantly, this is due
to the program searching from start to end in the list of numbers.

Our program is obviously alot slower than the sort function, going through each linked list is quite slow and would be 
quicker with some sort of reduction algorithm.
